We check the CDs and he got in the long queue. A few minutes later a spotted the fully black plastic case. And the barcode stricker said „West Kanye - Donda”. I rushed to my friend to tell him what i found „I have to buy this because its a Kanye West album”, He said „No way!!! Would you like that?” I said „Yes I will payback the price eventually”. In a nutshell it’s my Chrismas present, and I like the songs on it (mostly, it’s too much gospel for me) ",
